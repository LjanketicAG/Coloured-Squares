# Colored squares
 
## Interesting small task for junior developers
Goal of the task is to create 6 black squares.
When a square is clicked it changes color (Black -> Green && Green -> Black)
When all 6 squares are colored Green, all 6 squares should turn to Black color.
Squares should return to being colored Black in the reverse order they were turned Green.
Process of reverting all 6 squares back to color Black should be clearly visible and distinguishable (Squares should change color one after another)
